Pandora FMS agent for embedded devices
--------------------------------------

This is a first approach to a specific development for embedded devices
running Linux, specifically ARM-based devices. 

This Pandora FMS agent will not have all the features on the standard
Pandora FMS agents, and will have a different approach due it's developed in
C and have a completely different target. It's main goal is to have a plattform
to access serial devices connected to embedded Linux and report it's information
to a central Pandora FMS server.

In the future also will be used as a "cheap" hardware concentrator for other devices
to send information to a single point, being like a tentacle proxy. Tentacle server should
be developed prior to implement this mode (called Drone mode).
