Installing Pandora Agent in Unix systems
========================================

Pandora currently has agents for Linux, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX(*), and BSD (IPSO, FreeBSD, OpenBSD...) (*)

(*) Only Pandora Agent vesion 1.1, not version 1.2

Pandora Agent is a shell script that collects info from host machine, write in a XML file (called datafile), and send to the server using SSH (scp) or using any other way, like automated FTP.

There are two configuration files:

pandora_agent.conf
pandora_user.conf

A script file (the pandora agent)

pandora_agent.sh

And a startup script

pandora_agent_daemon

Pandora Agents use pandora_agent.conf to load initial data and load module data. Modules are atomic source of information. Please refer to Pandora Agents configuration - Quick Guide for more information. 

pandora_user.conf is low level configuration. It will be executed in each iteration of pandora_agent.sh script. Please read it and see how it works.

There are a startup script called "pandora_agent_daemon" used to load Pandora Agent at boot time, and to stop ip. It depends on what type of Unix are you running. Test it before including it your init level script directory, it accepts start / stop / restart commands, like usual in Unix System V systems.
