	type for monitor_report (id 6) which made the jQuery not show the
	agent/module select box and subsequently the graph failed

	* godmode/agentes/module_manager_editor_data.php,
	godmode/agentes/module_manager_editor.php,

	* include/functions.php: Made get_alert_days() output translatable.

	translatable

	* godmode/db/times_incl.php: This file is actually only relied on by
	db_info.php so I removed it and included the contents in db_info

	* godmode/db/db_purge.php: Since we went over the threshhold of 1,5M
	data entries on a P4, the page would timeout from the browser out. So
	I reworked the page to clarify the variables and adhere to style. Put
	the delete query in a transaction (since it might be that either
	timeouts or other errors don't clean the whole database up and then
	you have to do it manually. Code is also prettier now.

	* godmode/db/db_main.php: Made it display the actual numbers instead of
	repeating the string.

	* godmode/db/db_info_data.php: Moved into db_info.php

2008-09-03  Sancho Lerena <slerena@artica.es>

	* configurar_agente.php : Fixed Undefined index: combo_snmp_oid notice error.
	
	* estado_grupo.php: Detect old "OK" monitors, but doesnt check if they are down 
	in time, so for example, a old monitor with OK signal but from a week old, it is
	shown as GREEN (good) value, not as a DOWN (white with ? symbol). FIXED. 
	Now counts data modules for DOWN total account, and show grey button if ANY
	type of module is down, not only monitors. Improved SQL searches. 

	* estado_agente.php, estado_ultimopaquete.php: Same as estado_grupo with data_modules, 
	included in total account, more accurate accounting. A new value shown in grey for 
	DOWN modules, being monitors or single data modules, no matter type. Improved SQL 
	searches. Individual module intervals are used to determine if a module is down, 
	if there is no individual module interval, global agent interval is used. 
	Now it's possible to have a module with higher interval than Agent interval, so 
	we take now the more higest interval in modules to calculate if an agent is DOWN.

	* fgraph.php: updated progressbar function to show N/A when data is above 100 or below 0.
