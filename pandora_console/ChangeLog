	godmode/agentes/manage_config.php: Style correction.

2009-01-12  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* pandoradb.sql: Removed fields "timestamp" and "id_agente" (and altered
	some indexes) on tagente_datos, tagente_datos_string and 
	tagente_datos_inc.

	tagente_estado table: removed cambio, added status_changes, last_status.
	tagente_modulo: added five new fields (warning,critical mgmt., flipflop
	detection, history module and delete_pending bit.
	
	* agent_manager.php: Group ALL not shown anymore.

	* configurar_agente.php: Support for new options. Delete a module now
	mark for deletion the module, not delete data (It's VERY slow!).

	* modificar_agente.php: Delete agent now uses the global function, 
	minor fixes.

	* module_manager_editor.php: New fields initializacion.

	* module_manager_editor_network.php: At this time, the first module
	editor who implements the new fields and improve old ones (tcp data).

	* setup.php: Added support for new token: event_view_hr (Filter of max
	old (in hr) for the event viewer. Removed old tokens show_unknown and 
	show_lastalert.

	* functions.php: format_for_graph() has an important BUG that makes
	all units rendered without the "K" !!!!. Fixed.

	* delete_agent.php: Delete remote config (if present). Also mark 
	for deletion modules instead delete them (and let the data without
	being deleted, because it's a HUGE consuming time, and it's left
	for the daily db maintance process).

	* estado_agente.php: Updated code for view new status.

	* estado_generalagente.php: Total packets are removed from this view, 
	this was a huge time consuming SQL operation that don't give important 
	infomation. Groupname is now visualized.
	
	* estado_ultimopaquete.php,
	* estado_monitores.php,
	* estado_grupo.php: Rewritten much code to view new status and other
	minor changes.

	* ver_agente.php: Data view now works under the tabs and other minor
	changes.

	* events.php: Support for the new events and status. Added filter for
	username and for a max. hours old events. Some boxes are now hidden
	by default.

	* fgraph.php: Some graphs are now fixed and uses tagente_datos and 
	tagent_access with utimestamp and without id_agent index. Works faster
