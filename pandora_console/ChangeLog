	(for security purposes).
	
	* include/functions_db.php: Made all the database queries relying on a
	single query function for simpler management. Also made sure that no
	functions returned NULL because NULL is a valid database value. Also

	* ChangeLog: Create this file, prior to launch final 1.2 version. For the next
	versions, will use it for every branch and subproject.

	* configurar_agente.php : Fixed Undefined index: combo_snmp_oid notice error.
	
	* estado_grupo.php: Detect old "OK" monitors, but doesnt check if they are down 
	in time, so for example, a old monitor with OK signal but from a week old, it is
	shown as GREEN (good) value, not as a DOWN (white with ? symbol). FIXED. 
	Now counts data modules for DOWN total account, and show grey button if ANY
	type of module is down, not only monitors. Improved SQL searches. 

	* estado_agente.php, estado_ultimopaquete.php: Same as estado_grupo with data_modules, 
	included in total account, more accurate accounting. A new value shown in grey for 
	DOWN modules, being monitors or single data modules, no matter type. Improved SQL 
	searches. Individual module intervals are used to determine if a module is down, 
	if there is no individual module interval, global agent interval is used. 
	Now it's possible to have a module with higher interval than Agent interval, so 
	we take now the more higest interval in modules to calculate if an agent is DOWN.

	* fgraph.php: updated progressbar function to show N/A when data is above 100 or below 0.
