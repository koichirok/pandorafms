You have several options to use a SSH Java Plugin for SSH access from pandora:

OpenSource (GPL).

https://sourceforge.net/projects/gsi-sshterm/
http://freshmeat.net/projects/sshtools-sshterm/

Commercial (we cannot redistribute the binary)

http://www.cryptzone.com/products/agmindterm/

In this extension we use Mindterm as default. just Get the JAR file and put on the extension/ssh_console directory with "mindterm.jar" filename. It will work.
