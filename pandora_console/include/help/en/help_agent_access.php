<h1>Agent access</h1>

Agent access graphs render access "contacts" per hour in a graph with a 24hr (daily) scale. This is used to know the contact frecuency of each agent. This could be useful to detect bottlenecks and agent break down. This could be time-consuming and if you're low on resources, this option could be deactivated in main application setup.
