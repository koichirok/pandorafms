<h1>Special days list</h1>

<p>Allows to define special days, holidays and special working days, for alert templates. They are treated as the same day of the week you selected.</p>

<p>For example, assume that is a holiday, May 03, 2012. When you define '2012-05-03' with 'Sunday', that day is treated as the same as Sunday. The date format is YYYY-MM-DD. If you want to define same day every year, you can use '*' for YYYY.
</p>

<p>
Note: To enable special days list, "Use special days list" should be set on the alert template (step2).
