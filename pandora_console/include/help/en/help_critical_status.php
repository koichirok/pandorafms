<h1>Critical Status</h1>

<h2>Numeric type modules</h2>

<p>
These field have three values: Minimum, Maximum and Inverse interval. Configuring them correctly you will get that some values will show a module as critical status.
</p>

<p>
To understand better these options is better to see an example. The CPU module will be always on green in the agent status , so it simply informs of a value between 0% and 100%. If we want that the module of CPU usage will be shown in red (critical) when they pass the 90% of its use. We should configure:
</p>

<li>Critical Min:90</li>
<li>Critical Max:0 (limitless)</li>

<p>
With this, if its value is greater 90 it will be in yellow (CRITICAL), and under 90 in green (NORMAL). 
</p>

<p>
If we enable the Inverse interval checkbox, the module will change to Critical status when the value doesnt be between the setted interval. In the example when were below 90.
</p>

<h2>String type modules</h2>

<p>
These field have two values: String and Inverse interval. Configuring them correctly you will get that some values will show a module as Critical status.
</p>

<p>
In the field String we will set a regular expression. When the data matchs with it, the module will turn into Critical status.
</p>

<li>String:(urgent|serious)</li>

<p>
With this, if there is a word chain urgent or serious the module appear in warning state.
</p>

<p>
If we enable the Inverse interval checkbox, the module will change to the Critical status when the value doesnt match with the regular expression.
