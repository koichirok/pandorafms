<h1>Module definition</h1>
<p>
There are two modes for an agent:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Learning mode:</i> all the modules sent by the agent are accepted. If modules are not defined, they will be automatically defined by the system. It is recommended to activate the agents in this mode and change it once the user is familiar with Pandora FMS.<br>From version 4.0.3, in this mode,  Pandora console collect all the configuration specified by the agent configuration file the first time and thereafter any changes should be made through console, will not catch changes in config file.
</li>
<br>
    <li><i>Normal mode:</i> the modules in this mode must be conÔ¨Ågured manually. The self definition of the modules is not allowed in this mode.</li>
</ul>
