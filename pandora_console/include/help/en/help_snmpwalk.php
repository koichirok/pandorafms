<h1>SNMP walk</h1>

Pandora FMS has also a simple SNMP browser that allows to walk the MIB of a remote device by a SNMP Walk. 
<br /><br />
Walking ("SNMP Walk") over a device will make all MIB variables available, so you can choose one. You can also enter a MIB using numerical OID or human understandable format, if you have the correct MIB installed in your Pandora FMS Network Server.
