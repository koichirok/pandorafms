<h1>Editor</h1>

<p>This tab has most of the part of the functionality of the visual console editor, because is where you could create the elements, edit and place them. It is a dynamic page, so it will be necessary that your browser support correctly the javascript languaje. As you can see in the screen shot, the screen is divided in two areas that are well defined: the button box, the work area (where you will "draw" the visual console) and the option palette ( that is not visible in this screen shot).</p>
