<h1>Custom OID/Data #1-10</h1>

<p>These are regular expressions that try to match binding variables 1 to 10. If there is a match, the alert is fired. The value of the variable is stored in the corresponding _snmp_fx_ macro (_snmp_f1_, _snmp_f2_, ...). Even though only the first ten binding variables can be searched for matches, _snmp_fx_ macros are set for all of them (_snmp_f11_, _snmp_f12_, ...).</p>
