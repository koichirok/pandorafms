	heavy load systems. Now works very fine.

2008-02-10 Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	snmp_proc_deadresponse. Used to report bad monitor status from
	snmp if a snmp monitor request have errors (timeout or unknown OID)

	* pandora_network: Fixed bug for float data in snmp_data modules and 
	negative values. Code cleanup and trying a new method (more fast and 
	simple) to get SNMP data (using get method instead getnext). Better

	alert_recovery 1/0 (disabled by default to retain compatibility).

	* Config.pm: Support for new alert_recovery option.

	* DB.pm: Implementation for alert_recovery option. Added flag to pass
	to execute_alert function to do not create event on alert firing due
	event is previously generated on calculate_alert function. Changes for
	management of data_proc type. If data is invalid (void or "") now this
	situation is managed as "invalid data" or "cannot get data" and set to
	"BAD" status and data 0 to have the same behaviour that icmp_proc and 
	tcp_proc (snmp_proc behaviour is also changed in pandora_network on this
	commit also).

	* pandora_snmpconsole: Fixes call for execute_alert (added flag to 1).

	* pandora_network: snmp_proc returns 0 value and bad status if cannot
	contact or cannot set SNMP session (read above).

        * Config.pm: Updated version to 1.3.1-dev
        
        * DB.pm: Added generic db function give_db_free(). keepalive modules area
        managed differently. Now have type 100 and update only tagente_estado table
        discarding historic data, but are managed like other module. Update data (OK)
        when updating tagent_access. Old Keepalive modules are deprecated and not used
        since from 1.2 version was not working :(

        * pandora_snmpconsole: Some small fixes from unknown user.

        * pandora_server: Ignore files with size 0 (expect to solve problems with 
        zerobyte BADXML files, need more testing...). Keepalive module management
        are now managed in a different way. This works for me but needs more testing.

        * pandora_network: Minimal optimization in locking for SNMP threads.

	*  lib/PandoraFMS/Config.pm, bin/pandora_network: This little portion of
	code should fix problem detected in some very extrange module "blackout" 
	effect reported by Corona. Need check and testing before get as final.

2007-11-20  Manuel Arostegui <marostegui@artica.es>

	* lib/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Fixed a missing $ in sub header definition for args :( 
	and some warnings also fixed.

	* conf/pandora_server.conf, lib/PandoraFMS/Config.pm, bin/pandora_network:

	Merged code from NG branch: Added multiping check (global setting 'icmp_checks')
	on network server because in some WAN enviroments with erratic packet loss on non TCP
	connections would cause recurrent false positives. New config token added to config
	file (icmp_checks).

2007-10-03  Sancho lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* lib/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Fixed alert that fires always one time more than
	max_alert defined. Also fixed several issues with "Ceased" support for alerts
	and correct internal_counter problem. Now works fine !

	* util/pandora_db.pl: Purge of tagent_access was not working fine, and fixed
	another problem with id_agent 0 data in tagente_datos.

	After about 12 hours of intense testing this seems to work very fine, probably
	this server code will be the final ! :-)

2007-10-02  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@gmail.com>

	* lib/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Updated and fixed several problems with alerts. 
	Now notification of alert ceased is properly implemented and works
	inside threshold timegap. Event are fired using alert description and not
	alert type, and automatically ceased alerts (depending on min_alert and 
	internal counter) give up alert status and generate event.

	* bin/pandora_snmpconsole: Updated call to execute_alert.

2007-10-01  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@gmail.com>

	* util/pandora_db.pl: Added some fixes and new checks for database
	consistency. Also purge non-init modules (needed to avoid unused modules 
	that take too much time on network servers!).

2007-08-27  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@gmail.com>

        * lib/PandoraFMS/Config.pm: Updated version string.

        * bin/pandora_network: Fixed BUG with SNMP Timeout (net-snmp uses MICROSECONDS
        instead seconds!)

2007-08-23  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@gmail.com>

	* Fixed a BUG in daemon launcher scripts that makes to do not stop servers :(
	
	* Added a updated README.

	Renamed (deleted .pl).

	* Final changes (link is now over bin, and lib is real dir, for work
	with Makefile.PL).

	* lib: Linked to bin/PandoraFMS, for use in Makefile.PL

	* Makefile.PL: Perl standard interface for make (to install)

	* bin/pandora_db.pl: Some small fixes and information strings updated.

2007-07-31  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@gmail.com>

        * util/snmptrapd: Deleted binary.

        * pandora_snmpconsole: Fixed startup scripts. Many checks added to
        manage NetSNMP Trap daemon. Now uses /usr/sbin/snmptrapd by
        default. Solved many problems. This also solve bug #1763691.

        * conf/pandora_server.conf: Added snmp_logfile token (before
        inside CODE!, UGLY!).

        * bin/pandora_network.pl: I hope Fixed BUG #1763305 with Master Server.

        * bin/PandoraFMS/Config.pm: Support for config token snmp_logfile.

        * bin/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Fixed (stupid) BUG #1763304 with alerts.

	* bin/pandora_DBI_test.pl: This is in /util and shound not be there.

	* pandora_network.pl: Added concurrency locking for ICMP and
	removed previos method (repeating tests). This sould work fine and
	faster. ICMP Latency added as independent function. This sould go
	on a new library for 1.4 or 2.0 version. Removed some debug
	commented code.

2007-07-18  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* pandora_network.pl: BugFix: SNMP calls that was causing segfauls was
 	because NetSNMP (SNMP) library is not thread safe !. Simple locking
	mechanism was enough to run code safely !. Main SQL sentence fixed,
	removed some debug code. 

	* pandora_server.conf: added sample of network_thread token

2007-07-17  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Added generic access to database using
	give_db_value() function.

	tagente_estado using different values for "estado" field, (100 for
	non-monitors, 0 for monitors), in the same way console does.
	
	* bin/pandora_recon.pl: Testing changes for two items: (a) Bug
	detected in forking startup (-D). (b) Bug detected due creation of
	modules without inserting record in tagente_estado table.
	
	* bin/pandora_server.pl: Updated some flags (IO flush), and
	indenting some code.

	This should be definitive commit for Beta1
	
	* General cleanup of unused or old stuff.

	* bin/PandoraFMS/Config.pm: Now uses errorlog for each perl
	error. Now render database bad connect string in connection phase
	(useful to debug startup errors by blank spaces).
	
	* util/pandora_checkdep.pl: Small perl script to check all
	dependencies.


2007-06-25  Manuel Arostegui <marostegui@artica.es>

	* specs/fedoracore5/pandora_server.spec: Moving PandoraFMS
	  perl modules to the perl directory instead of leaving them
	  in the pandora_server main directory.

2007-06-22  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

        * bin/pandora_recon.pl: This sould be final modifications for recon.

2007-06-19  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* bin/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Added support to timeframe alerts.

	* bin/pandora_recon.pl: Threads is not a good idea, we need to use
	fork() in the future. At this moment, multithread disabled for
	recon.

2007-06-18  Manuel Arostegui <marostegui@artica.es>

	* specs/fedoracore5/pandora_server.spec: Added some useful tips.

2007-06-18  Manuel Arostegui <marostegui@artica.es>

	* specs/fedoracore5/pandora_server.spec: Ready for the 1.3 packaging.

2007-06-17  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* bin/pandora_server.pl: Now keepalive subprocess uses alert_check
	function fon DB.pm
	
	* bin/PandoraFMS/Config.pm: Updated version number.
	
	* bin/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: alert_check function now support
	individual alert disable.

2007-06-07  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	Important update. Now all PM files (library) goes on PandoraFMS
	subdirectory from /bin. This should be copied/moved to system
	default Perl libraries (like /usr/lib/perl). All .PM files changes
	it's name.

	We also replace Net::Ping for Alive checks because recently
	problems discovered in packet lenght payload and problems with
	threads. We fallback to Net::Ping::External, now rewrapped to
	PandoraFMS::PingExternal and distributed with PandoraFMS for easy
	deployment.

	bin/*.pm: Renamed to equivalent files in ./bin/PandoraFMS dir
	
	* bin/pandora_network.pl: Now uses ping() from PingExternal to
	make alive checks. Latency checks is the only function that
	actually needs root now. External Ping could be executed from any
	user (it uses PING from system).
	
	* bin/PandoraFMS: Now contains all .PM files for PandoraFMS.

	* bin/pandora_recon.pl: Now uses ping() from PingExternal.

	* bin/pandora_network.pl: Net::Ping::External does not solve our 
	odd problems. Fallback again to Net::Ping interface, not using a 
	double check to be sure that data is good. I hope this works :(

2007-06-05  Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* pandora_network.pm: Small bug that causes some hosts to do not reply
	at ICMP request with a small payload (1 byte). Now uses by default 
	32 bytes per reply. Also modified icmp_data for latency checks because 
	was not using global timeout and has the same problems with small
	payloads.

2007-06-04  Raúl Mateos  <rmateos@netscape.net>

	* pandora_server, pandora_network, pandora_snmpconsole: Added FMS text.

2007-05-21  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* pandora_network: Version banner update.

	* pandora_db.pm: Fixed problem in function
	module_generic_data_inc() that doesn't create record on new
	data_inc modules, only updates if already exists. Fixed and
	tested.

	* pandora_network.pm: pandora_query_snmp() function return 0 if
	cannot stablish connection. Also, snmp_data_proc value of 2 (down)
	is turned to 0 for Pandora FMS. Also, now when cannot connect,
	ONLY UPDATE last_try field, not timestamp field in tagente_estado
