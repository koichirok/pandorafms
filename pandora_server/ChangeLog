	function pandora_mcast_change_report() is done now on real status change
	code not in alert. Added update_on_error() function to update status table
	when remote modules cannot init (update last_try field to avoid unnecesary
	attempts).

	* Config.pm: Build update, some stuff cleaned. Server startup info is show
	only when verbose level is activated.

2009-01-16  Raul Mateos <raulofpandora@gmail.com>
	
	* lib/PandoraFMS/Config.pm: Updated Build and Headers.
	Changed some texts.

2009-01-16  Ramon Novoa  <rnovoa@artica.es>

	* lib/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Several fixes.

2009-01-15  Ramon Novoa  <rnovoa@artica.es>

	* lib/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: min_alerts now works as expected.

2009-01-15  Ramon Novoa  <rnovoa@artica.es>

	* lib/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Partially rewrote the alert core to support the
	  new DB schemas. Compound alerts have been temporarily disabled.
	  Rewrote alert macro substitution code.

	* lib/PandoraFMS/Tools.pm,
	  bin/pandora_snmpconsole: Aesthetic changes to enterprise code.

	* lib/PandoraFMS/Config.pm,

	postprocess calculation.

	* pandora_recon: Now is compatible with the latest changes. Solved a
	problem in eval() block. Also fixed a old bug mixing network profiles.
	This fix will be ported to stable version ASAP.


2009-01-12  Sancho Lerena <slerena@artica.es>

	* Makefile.PL: Path to libs was wrong. Fixed.
	
	* pandora_db.pl: Fixed small bug.

2009-01-12  Sancho Lerena <slerena@artica.es>

	This is a MAJOR upgrade that _BREAK_ your current 2.1 trunk version.
	Needs an upgrade of DB Schema. At this time no conversion tool has been
	provided. Libs and console needs also to be re-deployed.
	
	* pandora_server: KeepAlive module is now processed OUTSIDE 
	pandora_lastagentcontact() function, in it's own function. This makes that
	keepalive only be refreshed on agent data, not network. This should 
	make keepalive works as "agent down detector" in a definitive way, also
	it's an important performance improvement operation.
	
	* pandora_db.pl: Performance improvements. If compact days = 0 skip. 
	Compactation and delete needs to be improved in speed.
	
	* DB.pm: Added more generic DB access functions (db_insert, db_update, 
	db_delete). Major rewrite of pandora_writestate(). Now uses three different
	values for status (NORMAL, WARNING, CRITICAL) and manage all modules like
	old monitor modules. Uses new fields for control event flip/flop with a 
	counter. Also uses new WARNING/CRITICAL thresholds to calculate in store-
	time the status.
	
	pandora_accessupdate() Function now uses only utimestamp. Tagente_datos and 
	tagente_datos_string has been updated and do not use timestamp (string) and
	id_agent index anymore. Big improvement has been noticed in performance 
	tests after this change !. tagente_datos_inc has been modified also.
	
	pandora_writedata() needs a lot of improvement :(. Added support for 
	modules without history. 

2008-12-23  Ramon Novoa  <rnovoa@artica.es>

	* bin/pandora_recon: Added a timeout to pandora_getparent(). The call
	  to traceroute() would hang despite query_timeout being set.

2008-12-10  Evi Vanoost <vanooste@rcbi.rochester.edu>

	* lib/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: New table layout doesn't require timestamp anymore

	* bin/pandora_plugin: New plugin server skeleton, not functional
	yet. Need much more improvement, but code skeleton is done.

2008-02-20 Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* Merged latest changes on stable branch to trunk. Let's go to
	1.4 version !!	

2008-02-13 Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* pandora_server.conf: Added default entry for 
	snmp_proc_deadresponse
	
	* pandora_network: Fixed problems for snmp_proc module. Tested on 
	heavy load systems. Now works very fine.

2008-02-10 Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* Config.pm: Added support for new config token: 
	snmp_proc_deadresponse. Used to report bad monitor status from
	snmp if a snmp monitor request have errors (timeout or unknown OID)

	* pandora_network: Fixed bug for float data in snmp_data modules and 
	negative values. Code cleanup and trying a new method (more fast and 
	simple) to get SNMP data (using get method instead getnext). Better
	error detection and reporting. Pending to test in heavy loaded envi-
	ronment locking mechanism for session contruction.

2008-01-25 Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* lib/PandoraFMS/Config.pm, bin/pandora_network, 
	conf/pandora_server.conf: New options for tcp/snmp retries and timout

2008-01-21 Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>
	
	* pandora_db.pl: Disable compactation until fix bug in compactation
	function that currently delete data insted compacting it.  

2008-01-14 Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	*  conf/pandora_server.conf: New token for activate alert recovery: 
	alert_recovery 1/0 (disabled by default to retain compatibility).

	* Config.pm: Support for new alert_recovery option.

	* DB.pm: Implementation for alert_recovery option. Added flag to pass
	to execute_alert function to do not create event on alert firing due
	event is previously generated on calculate_alert function. Changes for
	management of data_proc type. If data is invalid (void or "") now this
	situation is managed as "invalid data" or "cannot get data" and set to
	"BAD" status and data 0 to have the same behaviour that icmp_proc and 
	tcp_proc (snmp_proc behaviour is also changed in pandora_network on this
	commit also).

	* pandora_snmpconsole: Fixes call for execute_alert (added flag to 1).

	* pandora_network: snmp_proc returns 0 value and bad status if cannot
	contact or cannot set SNMP session (read above).

2008-01-11 Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* DB.pm: Fixed alert management for KeepAlive module. (Optional) Code for 
	notify on alert recovery.
	
	* pandora_network: Better management of thread locking. This should fix 
	latests problems reported.
	
2008-01-10 Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* Config.pm: Version number update.
	
	* DB.pm: Support to manage keepalive modules in the correct way (more fixes)
	
	* pandora_server: Minimal improvement on zero data files, and new keepalive 	
	mamagement (more fixes over yesterday code).
	
	This is the first 1.3.1 version commit (Server)

2008-01-08  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@gmail.com>

        * Config.pm: Updated version to 1.3.1-dev
        
        * DB.pm: Added generic db function give_db_free(). keepalive modules area
        managed differently. Now have type 100 and update only tagente_estado table
        discarding historic data, but are managed like other module. Update data (OK)
        when updating tagent_access. Old Keepalive modules are deprecated and not used
        since from 1.2 version was not working :(

        * pandora_snmpconsole: Some small fixes from unknown user.

        * pandora_server: Ignore files with size 0 (expect to solve problems with 
        zerobyte BADXML files, need more testing...). Keepalive module management
        are now managed in a different way. This works for me but needs more testing.

        * pandora_network: Minimal optimization in locking for SNMP threads.

2007-12-19  Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* bin/pandora_network: Fixed bug #1854340, problem with file descriptors
	on heavily loaded network servers. Other minor issues added.

	* util/n2p.README: Added to repository. Nagios to Pandora FMS migration
	guide.

2007-12-04  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@gmail.com>

	*  lib/PandoraFMS/Config.pm, bin/pandora_network: This little portion of
	code should fix problem detected in some very extrange module "blackout" 
	effect reported by Corona. Need check and testing before get as final.

2007-11-20  Manuel Arostegui <marostegui@artica.es>

	* pandora_snmpconsole,pandora_server,pandora_recon,pandora_network: Fixed
	  bug #1822659.

2007-11-19  Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* pandora_network: Fixed problem with default retries of SNMP library. Now is 0
	
2007-10-09  Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* pandora_snmpconfole: Fixed parameter for snmptrapd call (%a instead %B). This
	was causing problems (do not detect IP Address) on Redhat systems.

2007-10-08  Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* lib/PandoraFMS/Config.pm: Updated build number.

	* lib/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Fixed some problems with alert recovery/expired method, 
	that causes to do not recognize expired alerts in some situations (min_alert=0).

2007-10-04  Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* lib/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Fixed a missing $ in sub header definition for args :( 
	and some warnings also fixed.

	* conf/pandora_server.conf, lib/PandoraFMS/Config.pm, bin/pandora_network:

	Merged code from NG branch: Added multiping check (global setting 'icmp_checks')
	on network server because in some WAN enviroments with erratic packet loss on non TCP
	connections would cause recurrent false positives. New config token added to config
	file (icmp_checks).

2007-10-03  Sancho lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* lib/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Fixed alert that fires always one time more than
	max_alert defined. Also fixed several issues with "Ceased" support for alerts
	and correct internal_counter problem. Now works fine !

	* util/pandora_db.pl: Purge of tagent_access was not working fine, and fixed
	another problem with id_agent 0 data in tagente_datos.

	After about 12 hours of intense testing this seems to work very fine, probably
	this server code will be the final ! :-)

2007-10-02  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@gmail.com>

	* lib/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Updated and fixed several problems with alerts. 
	Now notification of alert ceased is properly implemented and works
	inside threshold timegap. Event are fired using alert description and not
	alert type, and automatically ceased alerts (depending on min_alert and 
	internal counter) give up alert status and generate event.

	* bin/pandora_snmpconsole: Updated call to execute_alert.

2007-10-01  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@gmail.com>

	* lib/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Fixed bug for autoimported modules #1805654

2007-08-28  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@gmail.com>

	* util/pandora_db.pl: Added some fixes and new checks for database
	consistency. Also purge non-init modules (needed to avoid unused modules 
	that take too much time on network servers!).

2007-08-27  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@gmail.com>

        * lib/PandoraFMS/Config.pm: Updated version string.

        * bin/pandora_network: Fixed BUG with SNMP Timeout (net-snmp uses MICROSECONDS
        instead seconds!)

2007-08-23  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@gmail.com>

	* Fixed a BUG in daemon launcher scripts that makes to do not stop servers :(
	
	* Added a updated README.

	* lib/PandoraFMS/Config.pm, bin/pandora_snmpconsole: Real fix for problem in 
	snmplogfile.

2007-08-21 Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* conf/pandora_server.conf: Final fixes for default file.

	* lib/PandoraFMS/Config.pm: Fixed stupid typo in snmpconsole parameter.

	* bin/*: Disabled flush for each I/O (ready for production).

2007-08-06 Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* DB.pm: Alert time support uses TIME format instead numeric (changes requested
	by esanchezm).

2007-08-02 Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.PL: Missing dep updated and .pl extensions purged.

	* All (4) startup scripts: Updated startup script.

	* lib/PandoraFMS/Config.pm: Now servers dont get "Homedir" from command line, get
	config file directly

	Renamed (deleted .pl).

	* Final changes (link is now over bin, and lib is real dir, for work
	with Makefile.PL).

	* lib: Linked to bin/PandoraFMS, for use in Makefile.PL

	* Makefile.PL: Perl standard interface for make (to install)

	* bin/pandora_db.pl: Some small fixes and information strings updated.

2007-07-31  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@gmail.com>

        * util/snmptrapd: Deleted binary.

        * pandora_snmpconsole: Fixed startup scripts. Many checks added to
        manage NetSNMP Trap daemon. Now uses /usr/sbin/snmptrapd by
        default. Solved many problems. This also solve bug #1763691.

        * conf/pandora_server.conf: Added snmp_logfile token (before
        inside CODE!, UGLY!).

        * bin/pandora_network.pl: I hope Fixed BUG #1763305 with Master Server.

        * bin/PandoraFMS/Config.pm: Support for config token snmp_logfile.

        * bin/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Fixed (stupid) BUG #1763304 with alerts.

	* bin/pandora_DBI_test.pl: This is in /util and shound not be there.

	* pandora_network.pl: Added concurrency locking for ICMP and
	removed previos method (repeating tests). This sould work fine and
	faster. ICMP Latency added as independent function. This sould go
	on a new library for 1.4 or 2.0 version. Removed some debug
	commented code.

2007-07-18  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* pandora_network.pl: BugFix: SNMP calls that was causing segfauls was
 	because NetSNMP (SNMP) library is not thread safe !. Simple locking
	mechanism was enough to run code safely !. Main SQL sentence fixed,
	removed some debug code. 

	* pandora_server.conf: added sample of network_thread token

2007-07-17  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Added generic access to database using
	give_db_value() function.

	non-monitors, 0 for monitors), in the same way console does.
	
	* bin/pandora_recon.pl: Testing changes for two items: (a) Bug
	detected in forking startup (-D). (b) Bug detected due creation of
	modules without inserting record in tagente_estado table.

2007-06-25  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	This should be definitive commit for Beta1
	
	* General cleanup of unused or old stuff.

	* bin/PandoraFMS/Config.pm: Now uses errorlog for each perl
	error. Now render database bad connect string in connection phase
	(useful to debug startup errors by blank spaces).
	
	* util/pandora_checkdep.pl: Small perl script to check all
	dependencies.


2007-06-25  Manuel Arostegui <marostegui@artica.es>

	* specs/fedoracore5/pandora_server.spec: Moving PandoraFMS
	  perl modules to the perl directory instead of leaving them
	  in the pandora_server main directory.

2007-06-22  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

        * bin/pandora_recon.pl: This sould be final modifications for recon.
	Fixed a bug reported by Enrique Verdes in the development list.

2007-06-19  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* bin/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: Added support to timeframe alerts.

	* bin/pandora_recon.pl: Threads is not a good idea, we need to use
	fork() in the future. At this moment, multithread disabled for
	recon.

2007-06-18  Manuel Arostegui <marostegui@artica.es>

	* specs/fedoracore5/pandora_server.spec: Added some useful tips.

2007-06-18  Manuel Arostegui <marostegui@artica.es>

	* specs/fedoracore5/pandora_server.spec: Ready for the 1.3 packaging.

2007-06-17  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* bin/pandora_server.pl: Now keepalive subprocess uses alert_check
	function fon DB.pm
	
	* bin/PandoraFMS/Config.pm: Updated version number.
	
	* bin/PandoraFMS/DB.pm: alert_check function now support
	individual alert disable.

2007-06-07  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	Important update. Now all PM files (library) goes on PandoraFMS
	subdirectory from /bin. This should be copied/moved to system
	default Perl libraries (like /usr/lib/perl). All .PM files changes
	it's name.

	We also replace Net::Ping for Alive checks because recently
	problems discovered in packet lenght payload and problems with
	threads. We fallback to Net::Ping::External, now rewrapped to
	PandoraFMS::PingExternal and distributed with PandoraFMS for easy
	deployment.

	bin/*.pm: Renamed to equivalent files in ./bin/PandoraFMS dir
	
	* bin/pandora_network.pl: Now uses ping() from PingExternal to
	make alive checks. Latency checks is the only function that
	actually needs root now. External Ping could be executed from any
	user (it uses PING from system).
	
	* bin/PandoraFMS: Now contains all .PM files for PandoraFMS.

	* bin/pandora_recon.pl: Now uses ping() from PingExternal.

	* bin/pandora_network.pl: Net::Ping::External does not solve our 
	odd problems. Fallback again to Net::Ping interface, not using a 
	double check to be sure that data is good. I hope this works :(

2007-06-05  Sancho Lerena <slerena@gmail.com>

	* pandora_network.pm: Small bug that causes some hosts to do not reply
	at ICMP request with a small payload (1 byte). Now uses by default 
	32 bytes per reply. Also modified icmp_data for latency checks because 
	was not using global timeout and has the same problems with small
	payloads.

2007-06-04  Raúl Mateos  <rmateos@netscape.net>

	* pandora_server, pandora_network, pandora_snmpconsole: Added FMS text.

	* pandora_network: Version banner update.

	* pandora_db.pm: Fixed problem in function
	module_generic_data_inc() that doesn't create record on new
	data_inc modules, only updates if already exists. Fixed and
	tested.

	* pandora_network.pm: pandora_query_snmp() function return 0 if
	cannot stablish connection. Also, snmp_data_proc value of 2 (down)
	is turned to 0 for Pandora FMS. Also, now when cannot connect,
	ONLY UPDATE last_try field, not timestamp field in tagente_estado
	table. I don't know why was in that way until this moment ¿?

2007-05-07  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* bin/pandora_db.pm: Fixed some problems with quotes and other
	aditional checks.

	* bin/pandora_network.pl: Fixed some problems with quotes and
	other aditional checks.  Detected a serious BUG in snmplib for
	Ubuntu Freeze
	(already submitted as detected BUG with veryhigh priority). This
	makes pandora network server unusable on feisty until fixed
	:(. Bug item is in
	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/net-snmp/+bug/65047

2007-05-07  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* bin/pandora_db.pm: Fixed BUG #1714003 for data_inc unit division
	(I hope), need testing.

2007-04-21  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@gmail.com>

	* pandora_tools.pm: Fixed sqlWrap() function.

	* pandora_db.pm: Many changes and fixes: data_inc process function
	almost rewritten to fix a bug coming from 1.x? who causes to
	insert as data the total value for first data arriving... so bad
	:(. This is now fixed. crea_agente_modulo() now return id of
	agent_module created so we skip another timeconsuming query
	:). Added give_group_disabled() for next feature about Group
	Disabled doesnt fire alerts nor events. Fixed crea_agente_modulo()
	with many not defined checks.

	* pandora_network.pm: Fixed terrible bug in reference parameters
	that cause pandora_query_tcp() dont work properly.

2007-04-19  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* pandora_tools.pm: Now expor sqlWrap() function to parse " and '
	chars in some SQL sentences. Use with careful.

	* pandora_network.pm: Fixed little bug with undeclared variable
	warning.

	* pandora_db.pm: Implemented NEW text alerts with regexp. Internal
	audit now uses macros for alerts. Fixed a bug in
	crea_agente_modulo() when uses ' chars in name or module
	description (using sqlWrap to clean text). General code cleanup.
	
2007-04-19  Manuel Arostegui <marostegui@artica.es>

	* pandora_config.pm: Now stores $pa_config->{'server_id'}
	available for any function in Pandora FMS Server.

	* pandora_db.pm: Several verbosity level adjustements in logger
	functions in all code. Some debug code purged. Alert code now
	should store group correctly in events. Renamed
	"processed_by_server" field from tagente_estado by "running_by",
	updated some code. pandora_updateserver() now stores also server
	version.

	* pandora_network.pm: pandora_serverkeepaliver now run more
	exactly and does not apply any delay. Module selection now uses
	utimestamp AND the new running_by to know that other instance of
	server is currently running this module. TCP code has moved to
	function pandora_query_tcp() -code cleanup-. UDP code deleted
	(doesn't work, and never used!). Fixed important bug in ICMP Proc
	that causes constant FLIPFLOP in monitors since last commit. Fixed
	also a problem from that version updating status timestamp. Lastry
	field only be used now for checking 24hr without updating tdata
	table.

	* pandora_server.conf: Updated some text and formatting, more
	clear now.
	
2007-03-23  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* pandora_tools.pm: Added sqlWrap function to manage quotes.

	* pandora_network.pm: MAJOR changes in internal architecture: Now
	uses 10 threads for manage network tasks and one only to keep
	server alive. Now catch TERM signal and log it. New function to
	check UDP services. This should be enought for improve network
	server performance until 2.0 version :-)

	* pandora_db.pm: pandora_calcula_alerta now calls execute_alert
	and clenanup alert code. Fixed bug with Internal audit
	alert. Addded fix from Dassing to pandora_writestate and added
	more fixes for 24hr data problem that include fix
	odule_generic_data.. functions.  pandora_audit () now uses
	utimestamp also.

2007-03-19  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* pandora_recon: Startup script for recon server.

	* pandora_recon.pl: Major code cleanup. First "complete" version,
	this sould be enought for a while. Works for me.

	* pandora_db.pm: Added generic functions to add incident . Added
	function give_network_component_profile_name(). Now updates
	correctly recon server status in pandora_updateserver function
	call.
	
	* pandora_network.pm: Replaced Net::Ping::External usage with
	Net::Ping library. This should fix many problems with some
	distros. Added pandora_ping_icmp() function to check ICMP boolean.
	
	
2007-03-12  Sancho Lerena  <slerena@artica.es>

	* util/pandora_dbstress.pl: Upgraded. Now admits one agent or all
	agent.
	
	* bin/pandora_recon.pl: New network recon server, to autoexplore
	new machines and add to monitorization automatically. Not
	finished, first version, first commit to SVN :-)

	* bin/pandora_db.pm: Now pandora_writestate() writes new fields
	current_interval, processed_by_server into tagente_estado
	table. This increase seeks for Unknown modules, and to know what
	server manage the module (data or network).

	* bin/pandora_server.pl: Small changes in banners.

	* bin/pandora_network.pl: Small changes in banner. Small
	optimization, now server_id is only checked once.

	* bin/pandora_config.pm: Small changes in banner. Added support to
	new reconserver, added config hash "servermode" to maintain a
