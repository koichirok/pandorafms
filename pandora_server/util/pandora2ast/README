Text2Speech for Asterisk

1. Install Asterisk and Festival on the Asterisk machine.

2. Copy/paste what is in extensions.conf.add to your 
Asterisk extensions.conf (usually /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf)

3. Put the PHP script text2speech.php in your Asterisk 
AGI binary directory (on my machine /usr/share/asterisk/agi-bin)

Another host can then execute the actions in channelcommand with 
the proper variables by connecting through a clear text (try 
telnet) to: asteriskhost:5038

pandora2ast.pl is a sample Perl script which can be called with 
some options from Pandora FMS and will initiate a call through 
the Asterisk Manager (over port 5038). Modify to your liking
You can put it in /usr/bin or anywhere you would like. Then go
to the Pandora Console and add an alert with the command
/usr/bin/pandora2ast.pl _agent_ _data_ _field1_ _field2_

In Pandora you can specify an alert to call this script with 
the following options: _agent_ _data_ _field1_ _field2_ which 
will in turn initiate a call to _field1_ (which should be a SIP 
or other extension eg. SIP/6549 would call through SIP extension 
6549 - see the Asterisk manuals how to dial stuff) and have a 
caller id show up of _field2_. It will say as soon as the end
picks up in a computer voice: "This is a message from the Pandora 
FMS monitoring system. Agent _agent_. _data_"

There could be a delay as Asterisk processes the voice data.
