This plugin provide access to Babel Enterprise API to gather data to be
monitored with Pandora FMS.

This plugin has the following requirements:

1.- You need a Babel Enterprise installed with the API enable.

2.- This plugin was developed to collect single data not arrays of values
	so you only can collect for example the risk of one host or the risk
	of one domain per call. If you need to monitor the risk of all Babel 
	hosts you should do a call per each host.
	
If you need more information about plugin parameters just type:

$> ./babel_plugin -h
